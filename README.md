# Writing-Data-Science-Blog Project
A detail complexities of Jupyter notebook, csv, jpeg/png files all are accumulated on need based to write a final product of blogpost for data science project.For this project, we will pick multiple set of datasets available from [AirBnB](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). In pursuing to write this blogplost I had to lot indepth seraching and analyses for a final product.

## `Key Steps for Project portrayal`
1) Pick a dataset.
2) Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.
3) Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:

### Prepare data:
- Gather necessary data to answer your questions
- Handle categorical and missing data
- Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them
- Analyze, Model, and Visualize
- Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them.

### Communicate your business insights:
- Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind
- Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience
- Your deliverables will be a Github repo and a blog post.

### What I did
I've chosen two data sets from AirBnb sites location is greater Los Angeles CA and New York city area. I tried go as much deeper as possible with 5 sets of main questions all relevant to revenue earning for the AirBnb listers. There are multiple embedded questions were included for detail clarity.

In this project I used two Jupyter notebooks for both LA and NY City datasets. I did indepth data cleaning, feature engineering, natural language processing and  machine learning and data engineering skills as a data scientist.This project will show off my python software skills, including my ability to write clean, organized code!

Here is a single screenshot comes out as a product of our web-app.
